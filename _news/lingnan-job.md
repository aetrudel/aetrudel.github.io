I've started a 3-year postdoc at Lingnan University. I'll be attached to the [Philosophy of Contemporary and Future Science](https://www.pocfs.org) project, spearheaded by [Darrell Rowbottom](https://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/rowbottom/).

As part of the project, I'll be looking at the use of AI and other emerging computational techniques in contemporary science, and thinking about their ramifications for future science.
