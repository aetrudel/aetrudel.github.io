My commentary on Primiero's [On the Foundations of Computing](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/on-the-foundations-of-computing-9780198835653) is now online at *Global Philosophy*. You can check it out [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-023-09661-7). It's not open access, but [email me](mailto:ae.trudel@gmail.com) for a copy.
