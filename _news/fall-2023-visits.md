This fall I will be visiting two labs: the gravitational-wave group at KU Leuven, courtesy of [Tjonnie Li](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00137934), 
and the radio astronomy group at University of Hertfordshire, courtesy of [Martin Hardcastle](https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-hardcastle).
